                <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

                <p>The Who-owes-Who.com website has been made available free of charge
                    in the hope that it will be useful to anybody wishing to calculate IOU's
                    between friends. Although the Who-owes-Who.com website has been tested
                    successfully using a range of test data, the software that performs
                    the calculations is relatively complex, which means that it is possible
                    under certain circumstances for the calculations to be incorrect.
                    The calculations performed on Who-owes-Who.com must therefore be used
                    at your own risk. There is no warranty, and no liability or
                    responsibility can be accepted for any losses incurred by anyone using
                    the information, or facilities, available on the Who-owes-Who.com
                    website.</p>
        
                <p>Any bugs that are reported will be investigated and fixed where
                    possible, and over time users may come to gain a high degree of
                    confidence in the availability, reliability and accuracy of the calculations performed on the
                    Who-owes-Who,com website, and although these are all important aims
                    for the website, none of them are guaranteed.</p>

                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>Personal data outside of that necessary to perform calculations are
                    not stored on the Who-owes-Who,com website. User information
                    is obtained via Google Wave APIs. All data stored on
                    the Who-owes-Who.com website are stored against a user's Google Wave identity.</p>
